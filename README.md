# Wifi-Alarm-clock
An alarm clock that synchronizes its time with the Internet. The time and other things are displayed on an e-paper display that is updated every minute.


I use the MKR WIFI 1010 from Arduino with a Proto shield, Arduino MKR board for a microSD.

I use a 2.9inch e-Paper module from Waveshare.
